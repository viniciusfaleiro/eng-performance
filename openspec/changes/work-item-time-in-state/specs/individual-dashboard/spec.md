## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Work is distributed by type with hours
The system SHALL report the person's work distribution by task type — the share and the time per type
(feature, bug, tech debt, maintenance, docs) — from the person's work-item events, where the time per
type is the item's **in-progress time-in-state derived from its change history** (per the
ado-integration mapping), not the manual `CompletedWork` field. Work items with **no usable state
transition** SHALL be excluded from the distribution and reflected as "no data" in the panel's
coverage — never counted as zero.

#### Scenario: Type distribution returned
- **WHEN** the individual panel is requested for a person whose work items have recorded state transitions
- **THEN** each work type is returned with its in-progress time and its share of the person's total in-progress time

#### Scenario: Items without transitions are "no data", not zero
- **WHEN** some of the person's work items have no usable state transition
- **THEN** those items are excluded from the distribution and lower its coverage, instead of contributing zero time
